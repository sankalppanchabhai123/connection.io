#Different Techniques used 
For Server-to-Client Communication
Client server communication For server-to-client communication, which enables a server to send data to a client, common methods include WebSockets for real-time, bidirectional communication
 
#HTTP Long Polling:
This technique involves a client making repeated HTTP requests to a server, with the server holding the connection open and responding only when new data is available. 

Server-Sent Events (SSE):
A simple, one-way protocol where a server can push data to a client over a single HTTP connection. 
Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a server-push technology that allows a server to automatically send real-time updates to a web page over a single, persistent HTTP connection. It's a unidirectional data flow, meaning data moves from the server to the client,

#Short Polling:
The basic version where the client continuously sends requests at fixed intervals, regardless of whether new data is available. 
For Bidirectional Communication

#WebSocket:
The standard for full-duplex, persistent, real-time communication between a client and a server over a single TCP connection. 
gRPC Streaming:
A high-performance framework that allows for bidirectional, long-lived streams of data, often used for microservices and inter-service communication.
nitiated through an HTTP request and then upgraded, WebSockets are ideal for real-time applications such as live chat, multiplayer games, and streaming data feeds, providing low-latency.

#WebTransport:
A newer, high-performance protocol designed for browser apps, providing low-latency and high-throughput bidirectional communication over HTTP/3.
